## 📄 Abstract

**SA-IDS** (Self-Active Intrusion Detection System) is a novel framework designed to overcome the scarcity of labeled network traffic data in Machine Learning (ML)-based Intrusion Detection Systems. By adopting a hybrid approach of **Active Learning (AL)** and **Self-Learning**, SA-IDS improves detection performance while significantly reducing the cost and effort required for human labeling.

This framework employs a novel **cluster-based sampling approach** (utilizing HDBSCAN) to facilitate labeling automation, minimizing expert involvement by up to **47%** compared to traditional baselines.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Hybrid Learning Framework:** Combines Self-Learning (Pseudo-labeling high-confidence samples) and Active Learning (Querying Oracle for uncertain samples).
* **Cluster-Based Sampling:** Uses **HDBSCAN** (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering) to group informative samples, reducing the number of queries sent to the human expert.
* **Ensemble Detection Engine:** Integrates multiple classifiers (Random Forest, KNN, CNN) to improve stability, generalization, and robustness .
* **Flow-Based Analysis:** Analyzes aggregated network traffic flows (NetFlow) generated by **Argus**, ensuring efficiency and privacy (no payload inspection).
* **Automated Conflict Resolution:** Implements strategies (Homogeneity-based and Majority-based) to handle conflicting labels during the propagation phase .

## 🛠️ Architecture

The SA-IDS framework consists of the following operational modules :

1.  **Flow Information Generator (A):**
    * Utilizes the **Argus** tool to process raw packets and generate Network Traffic Flows (NTF).
    * Generates features excluding source/destination IPs to ensure protocol independence.
2.  **Data Preprocessing (B):**
    * Performs data cleaning, numeric encoding, and Min-Max scaling.
    * Selects relevant features based on statistical filtering.
3.  **Detection Engine (C):**
    * **Self-Learning:** Retrains the ensemble model using high-confidence pseudo-labels.
    * **Active Learning:** Identifies uncertain samples using Soft Vote Entropy (SVE).
4.  **Clustering & Candidate Selection (D):**
    * Clusters uncertain samples using **HDBSCAN** with automatic parameter configuration via DBCV scores.
    * Selects representative candidates to query the Oracle.
5.  **Label Propagation (F):**
    * Propagates the Oracle's labels to the specific cluster based on defined conflict resolution rules.

## 📊 Datasets

The framework was evaluated on two challenging real-world datasets:

| Dataset | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CTU-13** | Balanced | Contains 13 scenarios with 7 different botnets (Neris, Rbot, Virut, etc.) . |
| **CICIDS2017** | Imbalanced | Contains diverse attacks like DDoS, Port Scan, Infiltration, and Brute Force. |

## 📈 Results

### Detection Performance
SA-IDS outperformed unsupervised baselines (Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor) and matched supervised baselines with significantly fewer labeled samples.

* **CTU-13:** Achieved an **F1-Score of ~0.93**.
* **CICIDS2017:** Achieved competitive accuracy despite high class imbalance.

### Labeling Efficiency
* **Reduced Queries:** Significantly reduced the number of queries to the Oracle compared to standard Uncertainty Sampling.
* **Expert Involvement:** Minimized expert intervention by **~47%** compared to baseline Active Learning methods (e.g., AL_CNN).
